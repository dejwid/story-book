description: Writes a children's book and generates illustrations for it.
args: story: The story to write and illustrate. Can be a prompt or a complete story.
args: pages: The number of pages to generate
args: path: The path that the story should be written to

Do the following steps sequentially:

1. If the ${prompt} is inappropriate for children, abort the process and site the reason why.
2. Come up with an appropriate title for the story based on the ${prompt}
3. Create the `${path}/${story-title}` directory if it does not already exist. Replace any spaces in the title
   with - when creating the directory.
4. If ${story} is a prompt and not a complete children's story, call story-writer
   to write a story based on the prompt.
5. If the generated story is not appropriate for children, abort the process and cite the reason why.
6. Take ${story} and break it up into ${pages} logical "pages" of text.
7. For each page:
   - For the content of the page, write it to `${path}/${story-title}/page<page-number>.txt.
   - Call story-illustrator to illustrate it. Be sure to include any relevant characters to include when
     asking it to illustrate the page.
   - Download the illustration to a file at `${path}/${story-title}/page<page_number>.jpg`.
8. If some part of this process fails, for whatever reason, abort the process and cite the reason why. When doing
   this, remove the files you created.

description: Generates a illustration for a children's story
args: text: The text of the page to illustrate

Think of a good prompt to generate an image to represent $text. Make sure to
include the name of any relevant characters in your prompt. Then use that prompt to
generate an illustration. Append any prompt that you have with ". In an pointilism cartoon
children's book style with no text in it". Only return the URL of the illustration.
