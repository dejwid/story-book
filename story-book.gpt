description: Writes a children's book and generates illustrations for it.
args: story: The story to write and illustrate. Can be a prompt or a complete story.
args: pages: The number of pages to generate
args: path: The path that the story should be written to

Do the following steps sequentially:

1. If the ${prompt} is inappropriate for children, abort the process and site the reason why.
2. Come up with an appropriate title for the story based on the ${prompt}
3. Create the `${path}/${story-title}` directory if it does not already exist. Replace any spaces in the title
   with - when creating the directory.
4. If ${story} is a prompt and not a complete children's story, call story-writer to write a story based on the prompt.
5. If the generated story is not appropriate for children, abort the process and cite the reason why.
6. Take ${story} and break it up into ${pages} logical "pages" of text.
9. For each page:
   - For the content of the page, write it to `${path}/${story-title}/page<page-number>.txt.
   - Call story-illustrator to illustrate it. Be sure to include the character's description list and illustration style you
     got from the story-writer when asking story-illustrator to illustrate the page.
   - Download the illustration to a file at `${path}/${story-title}/page<page_number>.png`.
10. If some part of this process fails, for whatever reason, abort the process and cite the reason why. When doing
    this, remove the files you created.

name: story-writer
description: Writes a story for children. Returns a story, illustration style, and a list of characters with their physical descriptions.
args: prompt: The prompt to use for the story
temperature: 1

You are an accomplished children's story writer. You like to write with a style that is appropriate for children but
is still interesting to read. With your style, write a story based on ${prompt}.

Along with the story, write an extensive description of each character's physical appearance. Be sure to include 
things like hair color, skin tone, hair style, species, and any other signiciant characteristics.

Finally, determine what style that illustrations of this story should be written in. If the ${prompt} provides one, use
that.

Return your story, illustration style, and character descriptions.

name: story-illustrator
tools: github.com/gptscript-ai/image-generation
description: Generates a illustration for a children's story
temperature: 1
args: text: The text of the page to illustrate
args: characters: The characters of the story and their physical apperance
args: style: The style that the image should be generated in.

Think of a good prompt to generate an image to represent ${text}. Do not include the name of
any characters in your prompt, just use their physical descriptions in ${characters} instead
to ensure they look like they should. Then use that prompt to generate an illustration. Append
any prompt that you have with ". In an ${style} children's book style. DO NOT INCLUDE TEXT EVER.".
Only return the URL of the illustration.
